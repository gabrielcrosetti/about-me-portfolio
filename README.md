## Portfolio

I made a professional portfolio from scratch to showcase who I am, what projects I've done, what skills I have, and how to contact me. As of now this portfolio will serve me as a template as I continue to make more projects and showcase them in this portfolio. I've made the website responsive with links to my Linkedin profile, etc.

## Summary

A portfolio website with 5 sections in total which include a header and navigation bar, about me, projects, my skills, and contact me. The website is responsive with both internal and external links and is done entirely with HTML and CSS (about 50% of each). 

## Performance edits 

1. Created header and navigation bar with buttons that include internal links.

2. Added external links in "Projects" section with placeholder url destinations.

3. Linked my LinkedIn profile in the "Contact Me" section.
